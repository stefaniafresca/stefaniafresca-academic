Stefania Fresca is Assistant Professor in Numerical Analysis at MOX (Laboratory for Modeling and Scientific Computing) - Department of Mathematics, Politecnico di Milano, Italy, within the Future Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) Project. \
After carrying out her PhD in the framework of the ERC Advanced Grant Project iHEART (PI: Prof. Alfio Quarteroni) devoted to cardiac modeling, she spent two years as Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at MOX. \
Her research interests and expertise include scientific machine learning, reduced order modeling (data dimensionality reduction), deep learning, digital twins, and numerical approximation of PDEs, with several applications to engineering problems.
