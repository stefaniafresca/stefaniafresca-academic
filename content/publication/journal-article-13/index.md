abstract: We propose a deep learning-based reduced order modelling approach for micro- electromechanical systems. The method allows treating parametrised, fully coupled electromechanical problems in a non-intrusive way and provides solutions across the whole device domain almost in real time, making it suitable for design optimisation and control purposes. The proposed technique specifically addresses the steady-state response, thus strongly reducing the computational burden associated with the neural network training stage and generating deep learning models with fewer parameters than similar architectures considering generic time-dependent problems. The approach is validated on a disk resonating gyroscope exhibiting auto-parametric resonance.
