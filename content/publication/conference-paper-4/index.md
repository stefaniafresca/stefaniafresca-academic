abstract: Despite incredible progress, many neural architectures fail to properly generalize beyond their training distribution. As such, learning to reason in a correct and generalizable way is one of the current fundamental challenges in machine learning. In this respect, logic puzzles provide a great testbed, as we can fully understand and control the learning environment. Thus, they allow to evaluate performance on previously unseen, larger and more difficult puzzles that follow the same underlying rules. Since traditional approaches often struggle to represent such scalable logical structures, we propose to model these puzzles using a graph-based approach. Then, we investigate the key factors enabling the proposed models to learn generalizable solutions in a reinforcement learning setting. Our study focuses on the impact of the inductive bias of the architecture, different reward systems and the role of recurrent modeling in enabling sequential reasoning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how these elements contribute to successful extrapolation on increasingly complex puzzles. These insights and frameworks offer a systematic way to design learning-based system
